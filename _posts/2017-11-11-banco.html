<p>A statement profiler and analyizer, import CSV files, export a understanding.</p>

<p>Banco was written to summarize and profile csv files downloaded from online banks, we've all wondered where the money goes and this gem provides a simple solution to the question. The app compares the description/name of the transactions, accumulating the totals for the same string names, you're welcome to increase the string length it matches should you need but though testing it seems spot on.</p>

<p>Once your csv file is read in understanding is exported via a number of reports. You can instantly see the bottom line, review the summarized money in / money out, review the transactions indiviually and write all the details to a file. Everything is ordered in descending value with the details presented on your terminal window.</p>
 
<p>Written in Ruby with no dependencies the Banco gem runs from your command line and is available as a <a href="{{post.gem}}">gem</a> to download or you're welcome to the <a href="{{post.repo}}">code</a>. Open Source and free to use.</p>
