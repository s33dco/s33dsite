<p>Weather summary in your terminal for anywhere, anytime in any language.</p>

<p>You know how it is, you're making arrangements, you need to know what the weather outlook will be. This NodeJS package is here to help, querry the place and date from the terminal and you quickly have the answer.</p>

<p>Darkskycli uses the <a href="https://darksky.net/dev">Dark Sky API</a> for the weather forecasts and <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/get-api-key">Google API</a> for geocoding. You will need API keys for both to use this package - don't worry they are free (with in reason). Through in the super friendly <a href="http://yargs.js.org">Yargs</a> to handle the option parsing and <a href="https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv#readme">Dotenv</a> to hold said API keys and you're good to go.</p>

<p>You can grab <a href="{{ page.repo }}">code</a> or install the package from <a href="{{ page.npm }}">npm</a>.</p>
